I'm Sherry Zhang, a first year PhD student in Monash University supervised by [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Patricia Men√©ndez](https://www.patriciamenendez.com/). I like programming using R and the tidyverse suite is just awesome that it makes data analytics so simple :heart_eyes:. 

Recently, I created my first package [quickdraw](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/quickdraw) at [NUMBAT Hackathon 2020](https://numbats-rise-up.netlify.com/post/hackathon_2020/) with [Stuart Lee](https://stuartlee.org/).

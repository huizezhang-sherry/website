I'm Sherry, a first year PhD student in Monash University supervised by [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/) and [Patricia Men√©ndez](https://www.patriciamenendez.com/). Feel free to have a go at pronouncing my Chinese name: Hui-ze (Think of "ze" as the first sound when you say Zverev, Alexander - a raising tennis star). 

These days, I'm working on the diagnostics of projection pursuit optimisation and teaching [introduction to data analysis](https://ida-monash.netlify.com/) in R for both undergrads and postgrads. I created my first R package [quickdraw](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/quickdraw) at [NUMBAT Hackathon 2020](https://numbats-rise-up.netlify.com/post/hackathon_2020/) with [Stuart Lee](https://stuartlee.org/).

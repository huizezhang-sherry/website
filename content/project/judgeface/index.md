It is part of human nature to react to changes by expressing emotions while in many court systems, Justices are required to remain still to ensure the judgement is not biased. In this study, I assess the facial expressions of six Justices in six cases heard in the High Court of Australia based on Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System, which decomposes facial expressions into movements of facial muscles, also called action units. Command Line, Docker, R and a facial recognition software, OpenFace, are used. I found that Justices generally remain impartial during the court proceedings, however, negative emotions (i.e., sadness, fear, and anger) are detected more intensely and frequently than positive emotions (i.e., happiness and surprise), especially in criminal cases (i.e., drugs and sexual assaults).
